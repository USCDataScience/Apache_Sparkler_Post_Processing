# Apache Sparkler Post Processing using Machine Learning
This code gets connected to Solr DB created for Sparkler Crawled Data to do further data extraction, classification, filtering and insights generation using various Machine Learning models. 

The ML models are capable of using keywords list from user, extract features from URL content, and classify (score) output and update Solr parameter accordingly.
